# REF1329-N64-Gameshark-Clone
This implements the original LZ9FC17 GAL on an Altera EPM240. It fully supports all functionality to include: parallel port, 7 segment display, and the GS button.

The upper EEPROM contains the high bytes of the BIN, and the lower EEPROM contains the lower bytes of the BIN. Happy making.

PCB Thickness: 1.2 mm
