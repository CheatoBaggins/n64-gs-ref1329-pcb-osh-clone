# REF1329-N64-Gameshark-Clone
This implements the original LZ9FC17 GAL on an Altera EPM240. It fully supports all functionality to include: parallel port, 7 segment display, and the GS button.

The upper EEPROM contains the high bytes of the BIN, and the lower EEPROM contains the lower bytes of the BIN. Happy making.

I will be adding a BOM shortly, though everything is labeled properly in the schematic.

This is my first foray into Verilog, and I welcome any comments or suggestions about how I could have done it better.

PCB Thickness: 1.2 mm
